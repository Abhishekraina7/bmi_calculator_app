# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

The objective of this small project  is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. In this I have used various widgets and created my own custom widgets from scratch to fully create the inspired design from the Dribble.

## What I am creating

I am going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
